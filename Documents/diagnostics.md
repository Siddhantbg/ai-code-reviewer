# Differential Diagnosis: OPTIONS 200 OK / GET 404 Not Found

## Executive Summary

This document provides a differential diagnosis for a recurring error pattern where API `OPTIONS` pre-flight requests succeed with a `200 OK` status, but the following `GET` requests for the identical resource URL fail with a `404 Not Found` status. This pattern is observed across multiple endpoints under the `/api/v1/persistence/` path.

The analysis points to a high probability of a misconfiguration in the application's middleware layer (specifically CORS handling) or the API routing logic. Issues at the infrastructure level or with data existence are considered less likely but are included for completeness.

## 1. CORS Middleware Misconfiguration (Most Likely)

### Reasoning

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware is designed to handle `OPTIONS` pre-flight requests separately from other HTTP methods like `GET` or `POST`. A common failure mode is a configuration that correctly responds to the `OPTIONS` request but then fails to properly handle or pass through the subsequent `GET` request. The middleware might be terminating the request incorrectly or stripping headers required by the routing layer, leading the application to not find a matching route for the `GET` request, thus returning a `404`.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1.  **Inspect Middleware Configuration:**
    *   Examine `backend/app/main.py` for the `app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, ...)` block.
    *   Verify that the `allow_methods` list includes `"GET"`.
    *   Ensure `allow_origins` is correctly set to the frontend's URL or `["*"]` for development.
    *   Check the `allow_headers` list. Sometimes, custom headers sent with the `GET` request (e.g., `Authorization`) are not included in the pre-flight `Access-Control-Request-Headers` and get rejected by a strict policy on the actual request.

2.  **Add Targeted Logging:**
    *   Insert log statements immediately before and after the CORS middleware is invoked in `backend/app/main.py` to trace the headers and path of incoming requests for both `OPTIONS` and `GET`.

3.  **Temporarily Disable CORS Middleware:**
    *   Comment out the `app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, ...)` line in `backend/app/main.py`.
    *   Restart the application and re-run the request using a tool like `curl` or Postman (the browser will fail due to CORS policy, but a direct API call will reveal if the server-side `404` is resolved). A `200 OK` from `curl` would confirm the CORS middleware is the culprit.

## 2. Application Routing or Controller Logic Error

### Reasoning

The application's routing layer may not have a handler properly defined for the `GET` request, even if the path seems correct. This can be due to a typo in the route definition, incorrect path parameter naming, or a dependency injection failure that only affects the `GET` endpoint handler. The `OPTIONS` request often doesn't need to resolve to a specific controller function, so it would not trigger this error. The fact that both `/analyses/{id}` and `/stats` fail points to a systemic issue in the `persistence` router.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1.  **Verify Router Definitions:**
    *   Thoroughly inspect `backend/app/routers/persistence.py`.
    *   Check the `@router.get("/analyses/{analysis_id}")` and `@router.get("/stats")` decorators for any typos or syntax errors.
    *   Ensure the function signature's parameter names (e.g., `analysis_id: str`) exactly match the names used in the path decorator.

2.  **Log Inside Controller Functions:**
    *   Add a log statement as the very first line inside the `GET` endpoint functions in `backend/app/routers/persistence.py`.
    *   If this log statement does not appear in the application logs when a `GET` request is made, it confirms the request is being dropped before it reaches the controller logic.

## 3. Middleware Order or Interference

### Reasoning

The order in which middleware is executed is critical. If another piece of middleware (e.g., for authentication, custom header validation, or rate limiting) is positioned before the main router, it could be intercepting and incorrectly rejecting the `GET` request. `OPTIONS` requests are often configured to bypass these checks, which would explain the observed behavior.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1.  **Review Middleware Order:**
    *   In `backend/app/main.py`, analyze the sequence of `app.add_middleware()` calls. The CORS middleware should typically be among the first to be registered.
    *   Look for any custom middleware that might be acting on the request before it's routed.

2.  **Isolate Middleware:**
    *   Systematically comment out other middleware (e.g., `rate_limiter.py` if it's registered) and restart the application to see if the `404` error is resolved. This helps isolate the problematic component.

## 4. Infrastructure / Reverse Proxy Misconfiguration

### Reasoning

If a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Traefik) or an API Gateway is deployed in front of the application, it could be the source of the `404`. The proxy might have a specific rule that correctly handles `OPTIONS` traffic but fails to properly route the `GET` requests for the `/api/v1/persistence/` path to the backend service.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1.  **Inspect Proxy Configuration:**
    *   Review the configuration files for the reverse proxy (e.g., `nginx.conf`, `docker-compose.yml` for service routing).
    *   Look for the `location` block or routing rule that corresponds to `/api/v1/` and ensure it correctly proxies `GET` requests to the application server's address and port.

2.  **Bypass the Proxy:**
    *   If possible, send a request directly to the application server's port, bypassing the proxy.
    *   If the `GET` request succeeds when sent directly, the proxy configuration is the root cause.

3.  **Check Proxy Logs:**
    *   Examine the `access.log` and `error.log` files of the reverse proxy for entries corresponding to the failed `GET` requests. They may contain more specific details about why the request was not routed correctly.

## 5. Data Non-Existence (Least Likely)

### Reasoning

This theory posits that the application is working correctly. The controller receives the `GET` request, queries a database or storage for the requested resource (e.g., `analysis_id`), fails to find it, and correctly returns a `404 Not Found`. This is unlikely to be the systemic root cause because it would mean that *every single* request happens to be for a non-existent resource, and it doesn't explain why the `/stats` endpoint, which is likely not resource-ID-specific, also fails.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1.  **Verify Data Existence:**
    *   Manually check the persistent storage (e.g., the JSON files in `backend/analysis_storage/` or a database) to confirm whether the IDs being requested (e.g., `4ztRcClFHT81ERq4AAAJ`) actually exist.

2.  **Log Data Lookup Results:**
    *   In the relevant controller in `backend/app/routers/persistence.py`, add logging to output the result of the data lookup *before* any `404` or `HTTPException` is returned. This will confirm if the application is correctly identifying that the data is missing.

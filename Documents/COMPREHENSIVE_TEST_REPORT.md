## 🔬 Technical Implementation Details

### WebSocket Event Flow
```
1. Client connects to backend WebSocket
2. Analysis request sent via 'start_analysis' event
3. Progress updates via 'analysis_progress' events
4. Completion via 'analysis_complete' event
5. Connection monitoring with ping/pong
6. Automatic recovery via 'check_analysis_status'
```

### Resource Management Pipeline
```
1. Pre-analysis: Check resource limits
2. During analysis: Apply CPU throttling + monitor memory
3. Post-analysis: Cleanup memory + reset counters
4. Continuous: Monitor system health + adaptive throttling
```

### Connection Recovery Mechanism
```
1. Detect disconnection during analysis
2. Show user-friendly reconnection UI
3. Attempt automatic reconnection (up to 3 tries)
4. On reconnection: Check analysis status
5. Deliver results if analysis completed during disconnection
```

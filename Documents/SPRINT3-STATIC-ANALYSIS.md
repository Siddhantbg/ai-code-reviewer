# 🔧 Sprint 3: Static Analysis Tools Implementation

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

This repository now includes comprehensive static analysis tools for both frontend and backend code quality checking.

## 📁 Files Created

### Frontend (ESLint)
- `frontend/.eslintrc.json` - ESLint configuration for TypeScript/React
- ESLint rules for React hooks, TypeScript, and code quality

### Backend (Pylint)
- `backend/.pylintrc` - Pylint configuration for Python code
- `backend/requirements-static-analysis.txt` - Dependencies to add

### Automation
- `lint.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for automated checking
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks for local development

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Frontend Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
# Add the contents of requirements-static-analysis.txt to your requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Setup hooks
pre-commit install
```

## 💻 Usage Commands

### Frontend Linting
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint        # Run ESLint check
npm run lint:fix    # Auto-fix ESLint issues
```

### Backend Linting
```bash
cd backend
pylint app/         # Run Pylint check
black app/          # Format code with Black
isort app/          # Sort imports
```

### Check Everything
```bash
# From root directory
npm run lint:all    # Check both frontend and backend
```

## 🤖 Automated Checks

- **GitHub Actions**: Automatically runs on every push and pull request
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Runs checks before each commit
- **CI/CD Integration**: Prevents bad code from being merged

## 🎯 What's Included

### ESLint Rules
- TypeScript error checking
- React hooks validation
- Unused variable detection
- Code style consistency

### Pylint Rules
- Python code quality
- FastAPI/Pydantic compatibility
- Code complexity metrics
- Import organization

### Code Formatting
- Black for Python formatting
- Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Import sorting with isort

## 📊 Sprint 3 Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All static analysis tools are now properly configured and ready to use!

## 🔧 Additional Notes

1. **Workflow Location**: The GitHub Actions workflow is currently at `lint.yml` (root level). You may want to move it to `.github/workflows/lint.yml` for proper GitHub Actions integration.

2. **Requirements**: Make sure to add the static analysis dependencies from `backend/requirements-static-analysis.txt` to your main `backend/requirements.txt` file.

3. **IDE Integration**: Configure your IDE to use the ESLint and Pylint configurations for real-time feedback.

## 🎉 Benefits

- **Automatic error detection** in both Python and TypeScript code
- **Consistent code style** across the entire project
- **CI/CD integration** prevents broken code from being merged
- **Local development hooks** catch issues before committing
- **Professional code quality** standards enforcement
